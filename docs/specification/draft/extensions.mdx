# Extensions

Extensions are optional, additive features that build on top of the core Model Context Protocol specification. They are defined and governed according to [SEP-1724: Extensions](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues/1724). Extensions allow the ecosystem to experiment and evolve without requiring every client and server to implement every feature.

Official extensions live in repositories under the `modelcontextprotocol` GitHub organization with the `ext-` prefix (for example, `ext-auth`), and each extension has its own versioned specification document. 

## Official extensions

### [MCP Apps](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps): interactive user interfaces delivered as UI resources over MCP

## Using extensions

Clients and servers advertise support for extensions via the `extensions` field on their capabilities and in server cards, using the extension identifiers listed above. For details on negotiation and governance, see [SEP-1724: Extensions](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues/1724).
