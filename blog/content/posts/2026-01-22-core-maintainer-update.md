A lot has happened since we first released MCP. We wrapped up 2025 with a [major spec update](/posts/2025-11-25-first-mcp-anniversary/) and the momentum hasn't slowed down. None of it would have happened without the community: developers building MCP servers and clients, folks improving our documentation, contributors filing issues and submitting PRs, and everyone sharing feedback and ideas. That energy is what keeps MCP moving forward.

To keep that momentum going, the [Core Maintainer](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/community/governance#current-core-maintainers) team is evolving too.

## Saying Thank You

First, some bittersweet news. **Inna Harper** and **Basil Hosmer** will be stepping away from the Core Maintainer team to focus on other projects.

Inna and Basil have been with MCP since its early days. They helped shape the protocol during some of its most critical moments, from key design decisions to designing and delivering our official SDKs as well as helping ship all major spec releases. Their fingerprints are all over what MCP is today.

Thank you both for your contributions and your dedication to the project. MCP is better because of you.

## Welcoming New Maintainers

We're thrilled to welcome three new Core Maintainers to the team. They come from different corners of the industry, each bringing deep expertise in distributed systems, developer tools, and cloud infrastructure. They've already been active in MCP discussions, reviewing [Spec Enhancement Proposals](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/community/sep-guidelines) (SEPs), and helping shape the direction of the protocol. Most importantly, they share a commitment to keeping MCP open, collaborative, and driven by the needs of the community.

## Looking Ahead

2026 is shaping up to be a big year for MCP. There are multiple active SEPs working through the process right now, covering everything from authentication improvements to new transport options. The ecosystem keeps expanding, with more clients, servers, and SDK releases shipping every month.

MCP has matured. What started as an open-source experiment is now running in production at companies of all sizes. That changes what we need to focus on. With this team in place, we're working on the things that matter for the next phase: hardening the spec for enterprise scenarios, improving security and authentication patterns, and making sure MCP can scale to meet the demands of organizations deploying it in a wide variety of critical systems. At the same time, we're committed to keeping the contributor experience welcoming and the protocol responsive to what developers actually need. None of that happens without you.

If you want to be part of it, check out the [governance docs](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/community/governance) or see how to [get started with MCP contributions](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/community/communication). Come build with us.
