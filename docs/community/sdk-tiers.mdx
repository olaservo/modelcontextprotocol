title: SDK Tiering System
description: Feature completeness, protocol support, and maintenance commitment levels for Model Context Protocol SDKs
---

The MCP SDK Tiering System establishes clear expectations for feature completeness, protocol support, and maintenance commitments across official and community-driven SDKs. This helps developers choose the right SDK for their needs and provides SDK maintainers with a clear path to improving adoption expectations.

<Note>
  **Key dates:**
  - **January 23, 2026**: Conformance tests available
  - **February 23, 2026**: Official SDK tiering published

Between January 23 and February 23, SDK maintainers can work with the
Conformance Testing working group to adopt the tests and set up GitHub issue
tracking with the standardized labels defined below.

</Note>

## Overview

SDKs are classified into three tiers based on feature completeness, maintenance commitments, and documentation quality:

- **Tier 1**: Fully supported SDKs with complete protocol implementation, including all
  non-experimental features and optional capabilities like sampling and elicitation
- **Tier 2**: Actively-maintained SDKs working toward full protocol specification support
- **Tier 3**: Experimental, partially implemented, or specialized SDKs

Experimental features (such as Tasks) and protocol extensions (such as MCP Apps) are not required
for any tier.

## Tier Requirements

| **Critical Bug Resolution** | Within 7 days                                                                            | Within two weeks                                                 | No requirement         |
| **Stable Release**          | Required with clear versioning                                                           | At least one stable release                                      | Not required           |
| **Documentation**           | Comprehensive with examples for all features                                             | Basic documentation covering core features                       | No minimum             |
| **Dependency Policy**       | Published update policy                                                                  | Published update policy                                          | Not required           |
| **Roadmap**                 | Published roadmap                                                                        | Published plan toward Tier 1 or explanation for remaining Tier 2 | Not required           |

**Issue Triage** means labeling and determining whether an issue is valid, not resolving the issue.

**Critical Bug** refers to P0 issues: broken core functionality or security issues.

## Conformance Testing

All SDKs are evaluated using [automated conformance tests](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/conformance) that validate protocol support against the published specifications. SDKs receive a conformance score based on test results:

- **Tier 1**: 100% conformance required
- **Tier 2**: 80% conformance required
- **Tier 3**: No minimum requirement

Conformance testing validates that SDKs correctly implement the protocol by running standardized test scenarios and checking protocol message exchanges.

## Tier Advancement

SDK maintainers can request tier advancement by:

1. Self-assessing against tier requirements
2. Opening an issue in the [modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol) repository with supporting evidence
3. Passing automated conformance testing
4. Receiving approval from SDK Working Group maintainers

The SDK Working Group reviews advancement requests and makes final tier assignments.

## Tier Relegation

SDKs may be moved to a lower tier if:

- **Tier 1**: Conformance tests fail continuously for 4 weeks
- **Tier 2**: More than 20% of conformance tests fail continuously for 4 weeks
- **Any Tier**: Critical issues remain unaddressed for 2 months

## Issue Triage Labels

Consistent labeling enables automated reporting on issue handling metrics. Tier calculations use these metrics to measure triage response times (time from issue creation to first label) and critical bug resolution times (time from P0 label to issue close). Use these standardized labels across all SDK repositories.
