## Abstract

This SEP establishes a formal contributor ladder for the Model Context Protocol project, defining clear roles, responsibilities, and advancement criteria from initial contributor through Core Maintainer. The ladder provides transparent pathways for community members to grow their involvement and influence within the project while maintaining security through graduated privilege escalation.

## Motivation

As MCP adoption grows, the project needs a clear framework for:

1. **Contributor Development**: Community members lack visibility into how to advance their involvement. A defined ladder shows the path from first contribution to project leadership.

2. **Trust Building**: Merge rights and other elevated privileges carry security implications. A graduated system ensures privileges are granted only after demonstrated trustworthiness over time.

3. **Organizational Diversity**: With multiple organizations contributing to MCP, the project needs mechanisms to prevent organizational capture while welcoming corporate participation.

4. **Scalability**: Core Maintainer bandwidth is limited. Delegating authority to Maintainers and Reviewers through clear scope definitions enables the project to scale.

5. **Recognition**: Contributors invest significant effort in MCP. Formal recognition through defined roles acknowledges their contributions and encourages sustained engagement.

Without a contributor ladder, advancement decisions become ad-hoc, potentially inconsistent, and opaque to the community.

## Specification

### Guiding Principles

The contributor ladder operates under these principles:

- **Earned Trust**: Advancement based on demonstrated contribution, judgment, and sustained engagement—not tenure alone
- **Multiple Growth Pathways**: Code, specification work, documentation, and community building all lead to advancement
- **Transparency**: Criteria for advancement are explicit and consistently applied
- **Security-Conscious Growth**: Elevated privileges require sufficient time and demonstrated trustworthiness
- **Organizational Diversity**: Individual contributors must demonstrate commitment beyond their employer's interests

### Role Definitions

All pathways can lead to Maintainer, though the specific scope will align with the contribution type.

### Core Maintainer

Core Maintainers hold final decision-making authority for MCP's technical direction. This is the highest level of trust in the community.

_Note: The Core Maintainer role is intentionally limited to ensure coherent technical vision while the project scales. The interview findings about "core maintainer bandwidth" are being addressed through clearer delegation to Maintainers and Working Group Leads, not expansion of Core Maintainer numbers._

**Requirements:**

- Sustained contribution as Maintainer or similar roles over at least 6 months
- Demonstrated judgment on complex, project-wide decisions
- Trust and respect across organizational boundaries
- Deep commitment to MCP's long-term success

**Appointment:**

- Nominated by majority of Core Maintainers, approved by Lead Core Maintainers
- Or direct appointment by Lead Core Maintainers

**Responsibilities:**

- Final technical decision authority for contested or cross-cutting issues
- Stewardship of project vision and design principles
- Governance and policy decisions
- External representation of MCP
- Succession planning and community health
- Participation in Core Maintainer meetings and Core Maintainer meetups

**Privileges:**

- Final approval on breaking changes and major spec revisions
- Voting rights on [SEPs](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/community/sep-guidelines) (Specification Enhancement Proposals)
- Approval of Maintainers
- Governance voting rights / expectation of governance participation
- Administrative rights to all MCP GitHub repositories
- Listed in MAINTAINERS.md as Core Maintainer

### Lead Core Maintainer

Lead Core Maintainers hold ultimate authority over MCP's direction and governance. This is a lifetime appointment.

**Current Lead Core Maintainer:** David Soria Parra

**Responsibilities:**

- All Core Maintainer responsibilities
- Appointment and removal of Core Maintainers
- Final authority on contested governance decisions
- Project-wide strategic direction

**Privileges:**

- Can act alone where Core Maintainers require multiple approvals
- Veto authority over any decision
- Appointment of successor

### Succession

If a Lead Maintainer leaves their role for any reason, the succession process begins upon their written notice or, if unable to provide notice, upon a determination by the remaining Lead Maintainer(s) or Core Maintainers that the Lead Maintainer is unable to continue serving.

If one or more Lead Maintainer(s) remain, they shall appoint a successor (by majority vote if multiple), and the remaining Lead Maintainer(s) will continue to govern until a successor is appointed.

If no Lead Maintainers remain, the Core Maintainers shall appoint a successor by majority vote within 30 days, and the project operates by two-thirds vote of Core Maintainers until a new Lead Maintainer is appointed.

### Advancement Process

#### Self-Nomination vs. Recognition

Contributors may either:

1. **Self-nominate** when they believe they meet the requirements
2. **Be nominated** by a sponsor who has observed their contributions

Both paths are valid. Self-nomination is encouraged—it demonstrates initiative and self-awareness.

#### Process Steps

1. **Nomination**: Nominee or sponsor opens an issue/PR using the appropriate template
2. **Evidence**: Nomination includes links to contributions demonstrating requirements
3. **Sponsor Confirmation**: Required sponsors confirm their support
4. **Community Review**: 7-day period for community input
5. **Decision**: Approving authority reviews and decides
6. **Onboarding**: New role-holder receives appropriate access and onboarding

| Advancement To  | Approved By             | Minimum Sponsors             |
| --------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Member          | Any 2 existing Members+ | 2 (different orgs)           |
| Reviewer        | Maintainer in scope     | 1                            |
| Maintainer      | Core Maintainers        | 1 Maintainer + Core approval |
| Core Maintainer | Lead Core Maintainers   | N/A                          |

### Decision-Making & Escalation

#### Delegation as Default

MCP operates on a principle of delegation: decisions should be made at the lowest appropriate level. This enables the project to move quickly while preserving Core Maintainer bandwidth for cross-cutting concerns.

- **Maintainers and WG Leads** handle day-to-day decisions within scope
- **Core Maintainers** intervene on escalation, cross-cutting issues, or when required (spec changes, Maintainer approval)
- **Lead Core Maintainer** intervenes only on contested governance decisions or when Core Maintainers cannot reach consensus

When in doubt, make the decision at your level and document it. Escalate only when blocked, when the decision has project-wide implications, or when explicitly required by process.

#### Escalation Matrix

| Issue Type                            | First Escalation     | Second Escalation    | Timeline         |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------- |
| Technical disagreement in PR          | Maintainer in scope  | Core Maintainer      | 5 business days  |
| Technical disagreement in WG          | WG Lead              | Core Maintainer      | 5 business days  |
| Disagreement with WG Lead decision    | Core Maintainer      | Lead Core Maintainer | 7 business days  |
| Disagreement with Maintainer decision | Core Maintainer      | Lead Core Maintainer | 7 business days  |
| Core Maintainer disagreement          | Lead Core Maintainer | N/A                  | 10 business days |
| Code of Conduct violation             | Core Maintainer      | Lead Core Maintainer | Immediate        |
| Security issue                        | Core Maintainer      | Lead Core Maintainer | Immediate        |

**Escalation process:**

1. Document the decision, options considered, and points of disagreement
2. Present to the escalation authority with a clear ask
3. Escalation authority either: (a) provides binding guidance, (b) requests more information, or (c) escalates further if needed

### Contribution Pathways

MCP values diverse contributions. Here are recognized pathways to advancement:

#### Code Contributions

- SDK development (TypeScript, Python, etc.)
- Testing infrastructure
- Tooling and developer experience

#### Specification Work

- Drafting or refining spec text
- [SEP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/community/sep-guidelines) authorship or co-authorship
- Protocol design participation
- Compatibility analysis

#### Documentation

- User guides and tutorials
- API documentation
- Architecture documentation
- Maintaining content currency

#### Community Building

- Onboarding new contributors
- Working group facilitation
- Community support (Discord, GitHub discussions)
- Event organization or representation

#### Quality & Security

- Bug triage and reproduction
- Security review and analysis
- Test coverage improvement
- Release validation

### Working Group Leadership

Working Group (WG) Leads are a special form of community leadership that doesn't require Maintainer status. WG Leadership focuses on facilitation and coordination rather than merge authority.

**Requirements:**

- Member status minimum (Reviewer preferred)
- Demonstrated sustained engagement with the WG's scope
- Good facilitation and communication skills
- Ability to represent multiple perspectives fairly
- Working Group and Working Group Lead are sponsored by at least two Core Maintainers or one Lead Core Maintainer

**Relationship to Contributor Ladder:**

- WG Lead experience is valuable for advancement to Maintainer
- WG Leads without Maintainer status work with Maintainers for merge decisions
- WG Leads have authority over WG operations but not spec approval

### Recognition and Visibility

The community recognizes contributors through:

- **Contributor lists** such as `REVIEWERS.md` and `MAINTAINERS.md`
- **GitHub teams** for appropriate access
- **Public acknowledgment** in release notes
- **Speaking opportunities** at community events
- **Badges** (if implemented) on community platforms

### Stepping Down and Emeritus Status

Contributors may step down from roles for any reason. This is normal and healthy.

**Process:**

1. Notify relevant leadership (WG Lead, Maintainer, or Core Maintainer)
2. Help transition any ongoing work
3. Move to emeritus status

**Emeritus:**

- Recognized for past contributions
- May return to active status with abbreviated re-onboarding
- No ongoing responsibilities or privileges

**Involuntary Removal:** In cases of code of conduct violations or sustained non-participation, roles may be revoked following appropriate review processes.

## Rationale

### Why a Formal Ladder?

Informal advancement creates inconsistency and opacity. A formal ladder:

- Sets clear expectations for all parties
- Provides a common vocabulary for discussing advancement
- Creates accountability in advancement decisions
- Enables self-nomination, reducing gatekeeping

### Why Timeline Guidelines?

Timelines exist for security and trust-building:

- Trust is built through demonstrated behavior over time
- Security risks increase with rapid privilege escalation
- Deep project understanding requires sustained engagement
- Behavior patterns only become visible over longer periods

Exceptions require explicit Core Maintainer approval with documented rationale.

### Why Two-Organization Sponsorship?

Requiring sponsors from different organizations:

- Prevents organizational capture of the contributor base
- Ensures contributors are recognized beyond their employer
- Maintains diverse perspectives in advancement decisions

### Model Inspiration

This ladder is modeled on Kubernetes community membership structures and adapted for MCP's needs and stage of development.

## Backward Compatibility

This SEP establishes new processes without modifying existing structures. Current contributors retain their existing access and standing.

## Security Implications

This SEP directly addresses security through:

- Graduated privilege escalation with timeline requirements
- Two-factor authentication requirement for Members
- Multi-organization sponsorship to prevent capture
- Security onboarding requirement for Maintainers

## Reference Implementation

Upon acceptance, this SEP will be implemented by:

1. Adding the contributor ladder to `docs/community/contributor-ladder.mdx`
2. Creating nomination templates in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`
3. Creating `REVIEWERS.md` template for scope areas
4. Updating `MAINTAINERS.md` format to reflect role distinctions
