Today, we're announcing that **MCP Apps are now live as an official MCP extension**.
Tools can now return interactive UI components that render directly in the
conversation: dashboards, forms, visualizations, multi-step workflows, and more.
This is the first official MCP extension, and it's ready for production.

We proposed MCP Apps
[last November](https://blog.modelcontextprotocol.io/posts/2025-11-21-mcp-apps/), building on
the amazing work of [MCP-UI](https://mcpui.dev) and the
[OpenAI Apps SDK](https://developers.openai.com/apps-sdk/). We were excited to partner with
both OpenAI and MCP-UI to create a shared open standard for providing affordances for
developers to include UI components in their MCP clients.

Since then, the spec has been refined, the SDK has matured, and clients like ChatGPT, Claude,
Goose and Visual Studio Code have shipped support for this capability, with more clients
coming soon.

## **What Are MCP Apps?**

MCP Apps let tools return rich, interactive interfaces instead of plain text. When a tool
declares a UI resource, the host renders it in a sandboxed iframe, and users interact with
it directly in the conversation.

Here are a few scenarios where MCP Apps shine:

- **Data exploration**: A sales analytics tool returns an interactive dashboard. Users filter
  by region, drill down into specific accounts, and export reports without leaving the
  conversation.
- **Configuration wizards**: A deployment tool presents a form with dependent fields.
  Selecting "production" reveals additional security options; selecting "staging" shows
  different defaults.
- **Document review**: A contract analysis tool displays the PDF inline with highlighted
  clauses. Users click to approve or flag sections, and the model sees their decisions in
  real time.
- **Real-time monitoring**: A server health tool shows live metrics that update as systems
  change. No need to re-run the tool to see current status.

These interactions would be less smooth as text exchanges, whereas MCP Apps make them
natural - it's like using any other UI-based web app.

## **How It Works**

The architecture of MCP Apps relies on two key MCP primitives:

1. **Tools with UI metadata**: Tools include a `_meta.ui.resourceUri` field pointing to a UI
   resource
2. **UI Resources**: Server-side resources served via the `ui://` scheme containing bundled
   HTML/JavaScript

```javascript
// Tool with UI metadata
{
  name: "visualize_data",
  description: "Visualize data as an interactive chart",
  inputSchema: { /* ... */ },
  _meta: {
    ui: {
      resourceUri: "ui://charts/interactive"
    }
  }
}
```

The host fetches the resource, renders it in a sandboxed iframe, and enables bidirectional
communication via JSON-RPC over `postMessage`.

## **Why MCP Apps?**

MCP is great for connecting models to data and giving them the ability to take actions. But
there's still a context gap between what tools can do and what users can see.

Consider a tool that queries your database. It returns rows of data, maybe hundreds of them.
The model can summarize this data, but users often want to explore: sort by a column, filter
to a date range, or click into a specific record. With text responses, every interaction
requires another prompt. "Show me just the ones from last week." "Sort by revenue." "What's
the detail on row 47?" It works, but it's slow.

MCP Apps closes this gap. The model stays in the loop, seeing what users do and responding
accordingly, but the UI handles what text can't: live updates, native media viewers,
persistent states, and direct manipulation. Combined, they provide the model and user with
all the context they need in one familiar interface.

## **The App API**

To build new MCP Apps, developers can use the
[`@modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps)
package, which provides an `App` class for UI-to-host communication:

```javascript
import { App } from "@modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps";

const app = new App();
await app.connect();

// Receive tool results from the host
app.ontoolresult = (result) => {
  renderChart(result.data);
};

// Call server tools from the UI
const response = await app.callServerTool({
  name: "fetch_details",
  arguments: { id: "123" },
});

// Update model context
await app.updateModelContext({
  content: [{ type: "text", text: "User selected option B" }],
});
```

Because apps run inside the client, they can do things a plain iframe can't. They can log
events for debugging, open links in the user's browser, send follow-up messages to drive the
conversation forward, or quietly update the model's context for later. All of this happens
over standard `postMessage`, so you're not locked into any framework.

## **Security Model**

Running UI from MCP servers means running code you didn't write within your MCP host. MCP
Apps handles this through multiple layers:

- **Iframe sandboxing**: All UI content runs in sandboxed iframes with restricted permissions
- **Pre-declared templates**: Hosts can review HTML content before rendering
- **Auditable messages**: All UI-to-host communication goes through loggable JSON-RPC
- **User consent**: Hosts can require explicit approval for UI-initiated tool calls

If something looks suspicious, hosts can block it before it ever renders. Of course, users
should continue to proactively and thoroughly vet MCP servers before connecting them.

## **The Future of Agentic UI Frameworks**

[MCP-UI](https://mcpui.dev/) and [OpenAI Apps SDK](https://developers.openai.com/apps-sdk/)
pioneered the patterns that MCP Apps now standardizes. The projects proved that UI resources
can and do fit naturally within the MCP ecosystem, with enterprises of all sizes adopting
both the OpenAI and MCP-UI SDKs for production applications.

MCP-UI isn't going anywhere. The SDKs support MCP Apps patterns, with the Client SDK as the
recommended framework for Hosts looking to adopt MCP Apps. The community continues to
contribute extensively to the specification. If you're already using MCP-UI, keep using it.
Migration to the official extension is straightforward when you're ready.

## **Client Support**

MCP Apps are supported in:

- **Claude** - available today both on web and desktop experiences
- **Goose** - [available today](https://block.github.io/goose/docs/tutorials/building-mcp-apps/)
- **Visual Studio Code** - available in
  [Visual Studio Code Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders)
- **ChatGPT** - starting this week

For the first time, an MCP tool developer can ship an interactive experience that works
across a broad range of widely-adopted clients without writing a single line of
client-specific code.

> "_I am excited about the possibilities that MCP Apps opens up. Having seen a glimpse of what is possible, I cannot wait to see what the community will build._"
>
> - **David Soria Parra**, Co-Creator of MCP and Member of Technical Staff, [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/)

> “_MCP Apps builds upon the foundations of MCP-UI and the ChatGPT Apps SDK to give people a rich visually interactive experience. We're proud to support this new open standard and look forward to seeing what developers build with it as we grow the selection of apps available in ChatGPT._”
>
> - **Nick Cooper**, Member of Technical Staff, [OpenAI](https://openai.com/)

> “_MCP Apps extends the Model Context Protocol in a way that puts humans at the center. The industry has embedded assistants into individual apps, creating fragmented, siloed experiences. MCP inverts this by making apps pluggable components within agents. MCP Apps extends this further by bringing user interfaces into the agent experience itself._
>
> _goose, the reference implementation for MCP, supports MCP Apps. Developers can now build interactive experiences that render directly in conversation: games, calendars, maps, checkout flows. At Block, we believe the future centers on users navigating through one trusted agent rather than context-switching between fragmented experiences, and MCP Apps supports that vision. We're excited to support this standard and see where developers take it._”

> - **Andrew Harvard**, Design Engineer, Agentic UX, [Block](https://block.xyz/)

> _“As MCP evolves from ‘tools’ into a real platform for agentic work, VS Code has been treating the protocol like a contract: implement the full spec, track the latest transports and capabilities, and make sure server authors can rely on what they build actually behaving the same way for real developers. With MCP Apps, that contract finally includes the missing human step: when the workflow needs a decision, a selection, or exploration, the client can give you the right interaction without turning the conversation into a choose-your-own-adventure prompt.”_

> - **Harald Kirschner**, Principal Product Manager, VS Code, [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us)

> “_The MCP Apps extension addresses a gap we have experienced first-hand: text and structured data only gets you so far when developers want rich, interactive tooling. The ability to render dynamic UIs directly from MCP servers, with security built in from day one, is exactly what we need to build better agentic experiences. JetBrains is excited to explore bringing this extension to our IDEs and continue working with the MCP Community._”
>
> - **Denis Shiryaev**, Head of AI DevTools Ecosystem, [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/)

> _“MCP Apps address a real gap between what agentic tools can provide and how users naturally want to interact with them. The ability to render dynamic interfaces directly in conversation makes it easier to leverage MCP server capabilities in practical ways. We're excited to see this extension deliver richer interactions for users while enabling MCP server developers to craft experiences tailored to what they're building. We’re excited to see how we can bring these capabilities to Kiro and the use cases it’ll unlock for our users.“_
