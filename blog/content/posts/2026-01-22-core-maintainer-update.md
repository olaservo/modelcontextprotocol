A lot has happened since we first released MCP. We wrapped up 2025 with a [major spec update](/posts/2025-11-25-first-mcp-anniversary/) and the momentum hasn't slowed down. None of it would have happened without the community. Contributors, maintainers, developers building with MCP every day: you all made this what it is. Thank you.

Speaking of the people who make MCP possible, we have some news to share about the core maintainer team.

## Saying Thank You

First, some bittersweet news. **Inna Harper** and **Basil Hosmer** will be stepping away from the Core Maintainer team to focus on other projects.

Inna and Basil have been with MCP since its early days. They helped shape the protocol during some of its most critical moments, from key design decisions to designing and delivering our official SDKs as well as helping ship all major spec releases. Their fingerprints are all over what MCP is today.

Thank you both for your contributions and your dedication to the project. MCP is better because of you.

## Welcoming New Maintainers

As some folks move on, others step up. We're thrilled to welcome three new maintainers to the team:

Kurtis Van Gent is a Senior Staff Software Engineer leading AI Ecosystems at Google Cloud Databases. With a strong passion for developer experience and open source, he drives ecosystems and integrations across the portfolio, leading efforts like MCP for Data Cloud and MCP Toolbox for Databases. 

Each of them brings a wealth of experience and fresh perspectives that will help guide MCP forward. We couldn't be more excited to have them on board.

## Looking Ahead

The MCP community continues to grow, and with it, the responsibility of maintaining a protocol that developers around the world rely on. This updated team is ready to take on that challenge: improving the spec, supporting the ecosystem, and making sure MCP remains the best way to connect applications and data to LLMs.
